# The Snake Game
A well-known and popular game extended by `Multiplayer` mode and `heuristic-based AI algorithm` implemented using `Python` and the `Pygame` library. 

# Main menu
After starting, the user can choose the screen size. Then a menu with three game modes and the exit button appears.

# Singleplayer
In Singleplayer mode, it's just you against your own reflexes. Classic Snake Game. Maneuver your snake using arrows, gobbling up delicious apples to grow longer and stronger. But be careful not to bite your own tail or crash into a wall – one wrong move, and it's game over! With each apple devoured, the challenge intensifies as your snake grows in length.

### Singleplayer "Game Over" screen shows score and three buttons: "Play again", "Main menu" and "Exit".

# Multiplayer
Multiplayer allows you to play the same great game but this time with a friend! You can play together on one keyboard, compete with each other and increase the length of your snakes. Be careful not to bite your friend. You will then end the game and your friend will be able to continue earning valuable apples.

### Multiplayer "Game Over" screen looks almost like Singleplayer one. Has the same three buttons and shows score of both players.

# AI

The AI ​​algorithm uses heuristics to determine the optimal directions for the snake to move to reach food. He tries to minimize the number of moves needed to achieve the goal. It has some problems when the apple appears in an unusual place (e.g. directly behind the snake) or the snake grows to a longer size and starts getting in its way.

# Other Functionalities
### Press <kbd>ESC</kbd> during the game to pause it, or unpause if paused.
